# Hey there, I'm Kylo  

### Future MIT Engineer | JEE Warrior | Code-Learner | Writer in the Making

I'm a high school student from India, currently grinding hard for JEE and building my way up to MIT.  
I'm learning **Python**, starting with **web development**, and writing whenever I can breathe.

> “Success isn't given. It's earned in silence and shown in results.”

## What I’m Doing Now:
- Learning Python on SoloLearn
- Exploring how the web works (HTML/CSS/JS coming soon)
- Preparing for JEE Advanced with fire
- Planning projects to add to this profile soon

## Skills in Progress:
- Python (Basics to Intermediate)
- Web Development (coming up)
- Writing (tech + personal blogs)
- Notion, GitHub, and Staying Consistent

## The Dream:
To get into **MIT**, build world-changing projects, and help people realize that no background limits greatness.
